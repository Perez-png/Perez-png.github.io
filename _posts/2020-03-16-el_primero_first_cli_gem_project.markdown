First CLI Gem

One of the first things that I was able to begin with this project was the topic of what this Command Line Interface, or CLI was going to be about and what purpose it would accomplish. For many year I have always been fascinated with battles and challenges in that how they occur, develop, and resolve. Therefore I thought that I would shed some light on three unique characters within a module that happen to be at odds with each other and versus mankind in general.

Further, I was under the impression that we were to have fun with this project and, thus this result. Dracula, Frankenstein, and Wolfman have always been and played heroic examples of obstacles they had to overcome in  order to be understood. From what seems to be different beginnings, they end up in similar endings.  Nonetheless this is the topic and choices the user will have upon visiting this site.

Throughout this process, I have diligently taken notes, watched and rewatched videos, took part in weekly meetings with our leader who has helped me understand the tools needed to complete this objective. From the inception , through the different modules, classes, methods, and executable files, the end result would lead to a quaint experience with these three characters. 

While this process I am still trying to completely understand has a few quirks, I believe that I have written a program that exemplifies what needs to be done and presented in order for the users to enjoy their experience.  This has been challenging to say the least, but also one that I will always remember. 

One of the most difficult things to remember during this process was remembering exactly where each command, terminal , and execution were located. Where these were to be found was hard at first, but after some practice, it all began to fall into place. While this was not quite what I had thought this entire program was about, I now have a better grasp of what is needed and what must be done in order to create a successful project. 

Classes and instances were a couple of the components  that were essential for the project and not something that is easily understood, but with help and practice, it is not so intimidating as it was at first. I am deeply grateful for this entire process and program. I sense that with a few adjustments, everything will fall into place and life will go on. Many, many thanks for all the staff and coordinators of these programs.
