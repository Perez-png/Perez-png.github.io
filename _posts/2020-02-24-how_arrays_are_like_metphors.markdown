        Metaphors are used to compare or contrast different things in many of life's day to day communications. There are may examples of metaphors throughout life and our lives as well. It is something simple, yet complicated to describe. According to many different life styles there are many metaphors that have an important part in our understanding of life  and how it pertains to our daily lives.  For example, from the movies that have so much influence in many people comes the familiar quote" Life Is Like a Box of Chocolates", from "Forest Gump". Lot's of wisdom, yet simple in itâ€™s description of what a life mirrors our actual events. 

      In terms of Metaphors and Arrays, there are many similarities that are possible and are useful when approaching any obstacle that we encounter. Take for example working through a list of songs that can be related to with only a word. This word could be used to describe and communicate what we want understood through what ever means necessary. It would include some of the characteristics that the Author perceives and is aware of with the music, artist, and even genre that help an audience to understand the message being communicated. One object could mean one thing, but in actuality it is something else. 

      These messages or Arrays can take on a life of their own and would lead to a unique description of a Metaphor in which is being addressed. As far as I am aware of Metaphors are found and used to express thoughts, feelings, or objects that promote well being and are intended to assist a person or persons to relate to instances that we exchange or interact with in our daily processes. The metaphors can take on their own each individual meaning when used to relay a message such as the quote from movies that leave messages within messages. We tend to remember them longer than we realize. 

      Further, things change and often they do. Knowing this and the current state of evolution, there are and will always be many metaphors that will help communicate ideas, and thoughts that will promote well being for all walks of life. With cell phones,  the internet, and rapidly advancing technology, the future will continue to expand as it has done these past few years. Using metaphors to compare or remember a characteristic to associate with  something different things are often used when thinking about what we do in our day to day environments, and using arrays is one of those methods that we can relate objects with.  

      I am certain that there are and will be many ways of communicating and through trial and error we will all develop and form our own manner of communicating amongst ourselves. The future is here and where it leads has infinite possibilities that will most likely require metaphors and arrays when it comes to understanding the who and what we share with each other, and how this all leads to something different and something new.  Such is life.
