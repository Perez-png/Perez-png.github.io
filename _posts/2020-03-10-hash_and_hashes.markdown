   Hashes are used to create and  manipulate the way computers and programs interact with each other. In  terms of what this means , in my opinion, these are ways that computers interact and  communicate with each other. Hashes do different things with the programs they deal with and can be any size needed.  They are  also necessary for creating and building systems that provide important information for many different systems. 

   Hash or hashes are made to simplify and protect unique projects. A hash is used with information of one dimension, takes input, and converts or converts this information to a smaller size which makes it easier and unique fir whatever purpose it is intended to do. Once this hash is made it is done with algorithms and calculations that make it effective efficient for the purpose meant for. 

   Algorithms are used to make computations that are complicated and specific to different things that are being examined or made. So when and algorithms is used it is done so uniquely and hashes are part of the process. Pseudocode is used when combined with hashes that measure things and prints out a different result. These calculations, are then processed into the program or goal that the programmers are attempting to accomplish. 

   Hashes can be found in many of our day to day functions, for instance our cell phones, banking, shipping, and shopping operations need secure and functionable means for protecting consumers and users at the same time. With computers, TV's, and the internet, the need for these hashes will continue to grow and expand. Perhaps not as fast as the technology does, but nonetheless grow and expand. 

   I believe that we will need hash and hashes for many of our day to day logic and reasoning and this will be one of the things that we will depend upon when advancing our society and it's needs. Cars, airplanes, trains and just about everything else anyone can think of have and need algorithms and their ability to produce the results that lead to the best of possibilities. Perhaps someday, hashes will have their own way of inventing themselves like artificial intelligence. At that point intellectual property may allow or prevent further advancement of technological devices and functions.
