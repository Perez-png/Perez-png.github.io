Many years ago, I became interested in this field and told myself that this would be great to look into. That time is now and I believe that this will lead to an exciting career and direction for my life and those around me. As a Father, Grandfather, Uncle, Brother and friend to many, it is and will be a great undertaking that I am sure will lead to success. The legacy I am aiming for not only addresses this need, but also sets the standard for future generations to motivate and instill within their goals and objectives. 

Our family has very strong roots in education and the value of what such accomplishments can do for anyone are evident in our family and what we have been able to attain.  Our parents raised 9 children, and being the third in our family, the challenge is right and the time is now.  My Dad was able to get his Bachelor's, Masters, and Doctorate in Philosophy while raising us, and it seems that I am following in his steps. I have dedicated this challenge in his memory and determined to get this done. 

I am aware that I am not as young as I used to be but that is alright as modifying and adapting to different situations is and always has been one of my qualities and characteristics. Having gone through several jobs in my life I know that value of a great program such as Flatiron and what the possibilities are obtainable. 

Finally, I look forward to working with everyone with our assignments and will work diligently towards the curriculum and goals of this program. I would like to also add that if there is anything that I can do to help someone, I will do my very best to share the knowledge that I have gained through my life's experiences.

Cheers to all, and best regards. Time to get it done.
